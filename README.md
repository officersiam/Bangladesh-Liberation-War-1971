# Welcome to the Bangladesh-Liberation-War-1971!


The Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 was for independence from
Pakistan. India and Pakistan got independence from the British rule in
1947. Pakistan was formed for the Muslims and India had a majority of
Hindus. Pakistan had two parts, East and West, which were separated by
about 1,000 miles. East Pakistan was mainly the eastern part of the
province of Bengal. The capital of Pakistan was Karachi in West Pakistan
and was moved to Islamabad in 1958. However, due to discrimination in
economy and ruling powers against them, the East Pakistanis vigorously
protested and declared independence on March 26, 1971 under the
leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. But during the year prior to that,
to suppress the unrest in East Pakistan, the Pakistani government sent
troops to East Pakistan and unleashed a massacre. And thus, the war for
liberation commenced.

_**The Reasons for war**_

Both East and West Pakistan remained united because of their religion,
Islam. West Pakistan had 97% Muslims and East Pakistanis had
85% Muslims. However, there were several significant reasons
that caused the East Pakistani people to fight for their
independence.

West Pakistan had four provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, and
the North-West Frontier. The fifth province was East Pakistan. Having
control over the provinces, the West used up more resources than the
East. Between 1948 and 1960, East Pakistan made 70% of all of
Pakistan's exports, while it only received 25% of imported money. In
1948, East Pakistan had 11 fabric mills while the West had nine. In 1971,
the number of fabric mills in the West grew to 150 while the number in
the East went down to 26. About 2.6 billion dollars of resources were
also shifted over time from East Pakistan to West Pakistan.
Although East Pakistan had the largest population among all the
provinces, it had much less political power than West Pakistan. This
eventually made the people of East Pakistan rebel. Sheik Mujibur
Rahman, the leader of the Awami League in East Pakistan, explicitly
demanded more economic and political powers. The struggle finally
culminated into the war of independence.

There was also the language issue that kept East Pakistan and
West Pakistan in an uneasy status. In 1948, Mohammad Ali Jinnah stated
in Dhaka that Urdu was the official language for Pakistan. There was a
big argument about this because only the Muhajir in the West and the
Biharis in the East spoke Urdu. Most of the West Pakistanis spoke
Punjabi and Sindhi, while East Pakistanis spoke Bangla. East Pakistan
therefore disagreed; seven students were killed in a fierce protest on
February 21, 1952. This day has been remembered since then and is
observed each year to emphasize the importance of the Bengali
language. February 21st is now recognized as the International Mother
Language Day by the United Nations.

A devastating cyclone hit East Pakistan in 1970. It was called the
Bhola Cyclone. It killed about 500,000 people and made many more
homeless. It brought great shock and deep depression among the East
Pakistani people. But, the government did not provide enough relief to
alleviate the extremely miserable conditions wrought by the cyclone.
This caused enormous misery in East Pakistan.

_**The War**_

The Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a
landslide victory in the national elections in 1971 and demanded
autonomy for East Pakistan. The party won a 160 seats and a majority in
the national assembly. This victory also gave it the right to form a
government, but Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Chairman of the Pakistan
People’s Party refused to let the Sheikh become the Prime Minister of
Pakistan. This initiated the war. The Sheik gave a speech on March 7,
1971 when he urged the people to turn all their homes into a fort of
fight. He demanded transfer of power to the elected representative
before the assembly meeting on March 25.

Tikka Khan, a West Pakistani general, flew to Dhaka to become 
the Governor of East Bengal. But, the East Pakistani judges denied him
entry. Thereafter, on the night of March 25, the Pakistani army tried to
violently crush the Bengali’s opposition. Residence halls of the Dhaka
University were viciously attacked. On March 26, the Pakistani forces
arrested Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. On the same day, he signed an official
declaration for the independence of Bangladesh. M. A. Hannan, an
Awami league leader, is said to have been the first person to read and
announce the Declaration of
Independence over the radio.

Political events approached a climax. The
war between the Pakistan Army and the Bengali freedom fighters, the
Mukti Bahini, began. The head of the Mukti Bahini was General
Muhammad Osmani. The Mukti Bahini were trained like guerillas. India
gave shelter to the refugees and trained the Mukti Bahini. India also
helped with ammunition and its own soldiers. They attacked the
Pakistani army. During the training period of the Mukti Bahini, the
Pakistani Army encouraged Razakars, the Bengalis who did not want
Bangladesh to become an independent country, to suppress the
rebellion. The Pakistani Army faced problems as the monsoon came.
This helped Mukti Bahini because they could counter the moves of the
Pakistanis.

 India assumed an active role. Indira Gandhi ordered air and
ground attacks. India, having superior equipment and forces, mounted a
three-pronged movement on Dhaka from the Indian province West
Bengal, Assam, and Tripura. The Indian soldiers, Air Force, and Navy
defeated the Pakistani army, while the Bangladeshi Navy helped India.
On the ground, three groups of Mukti Bahini and Indian forces fought the
Pakistanis. The Pakistanis tried to fight back, but failed to resist them.
The Victory On December 16th, 1971, Dhaka fell to the Mitro Bahini, the elite
forces of the Mukti Bahini and the Indian army. An “Instrument of
Surrender” was signed by the defeated Pakistani General Niazi and by
the Indian commander General Aurora at 16:31 Indian Standard Time.
This is how Bangladesh became liberated and independent. December
16th is recognized as the Victory Day in Bangladesh, while March 26 is
recognized as the Independence Day. With sovereignty, Bangladesh is
progressing in all aspects.
